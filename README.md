# CC_Fraud_Detection

This project was found on Kaggle. I completed it as a review of Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM while detecting credit card fraud. This project was a good review of identifying proper threshold with logistic regression, interpretting confusion matrices, and the ROC Curve.  In-sample and out of sample accuracy scores were also reviewed. All methods were then compared, with the Random Forst classifier performing the best. I found this exercise to have been very useful, easily reproducible, and I would be comfortable implementing this in the future.
